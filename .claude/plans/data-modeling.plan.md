## Entities

### Task

The central entity. Represents a discrete unit of work.

| Attribute     | Type       | Required | Mutable | Description                                               |
|---------------|------------|----------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`          | Identifier | Yes      | No      | Unique, system-generated at creation                      |
| `description` | Text       | Yes      | Yes     | Human-readable description of the work; cannot be empty  |
| `done`        | Boolean    | Yes      | Yes     | Whether the task has been completed; defaults to `false`  |
| `doneAt`      | Timestamp  | No       | Yes     | Set when the task is completed; cleared when reopened     |
| `contextId`   | Identifier | No       | Yes     | FK → Context. Situational tag for the task                |
| `projectId`   | Identifier | No       | Yes     | FK → Project. Goal grouping for the task                  |
| `createdAt`   | Timestamp  | Yes      | No      | Set once at creation                                      |
| `updatedAt`   | Timestamp  | Yes      | Auto    | Updated automatically on every successful mutation        |

**Constraints:**
- `description` must be a non-empty, non-whitespace string at all times.
- `done` defaults to `false` on creation.
- `doneAt` is `null` on creation. It is set to the current timestamp when the task is completed and cleared to `null` when the task is reopened. It must always be consistent with `done` (`done: true` ↔ `doneAt` is set).
- `contextId`, if set, must reference an existing Context.
- `projectId`, if set, must reference an existing Project.

### Context

Represents a situational condition under which tasks are actionable. Examples: "at home", "with laptop", "low energy", "waiting for".

| Attribute   | Type       | Required | Mutable | Description                                              |
|-------------|------------|----------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`        | Identifier | Yes      | No      | Unique, system-generated at creation                     |
| `title`     | Text       | Yes      | Yes     | Name of the context; must be unique (case-insensitive)   |
| `createdAt` | Timestamp  | Yes      | No      | Set once at creation                                     |
| `updatedAt` | Timestamp  | Yes      | Auto    | Updated automatically on every successful mutation       |

**Constraints:**
- `title` must be a non-empty, non-whitespace string at all times.
- `title` must be unique across all Contexts (case-insensitive). Duplicates are rejected on create and on rename.
- A Context cannot be deleted while it is referenced by one or more Tasks.

### Project

Represents a goal or initiative that groups related tasks toward a desired outcome.

| Attribute   | Type       | Required | Mutable | Description                                              |
|-------------|------------|----------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`        | Identifier | Yes      | No      | Unique, system-generated at creation                     |
| `title`     | Text       | Yes      | Yes     | Name of the project; must be unique (case-insensitive)   |
| `createdAt` | Timestamp  | Yes      | No      | Set once at creation                                     |
| `updatedAt` | Timestamp  | Yes      | Auto    | Updated automatically on every successful mutation       |

**Constraints:**
- `title` must be a non-empty, non-whitespace string at all times.
- `title` must be unique across all Projects (case-insensitive). Duplicates are rejected on create and on rename.
- A Project cannot be deleted while it is referenced by one or more Tasks.

## Relationships

### Task ↔ Context (many-to-one, optional)

```
Task 0..* ──── 0..1 Context
```

- A Task may be associated with zero or one Context.
- A Context may be associated with zero or many Tasks.
- The association is set via `Task.contextId`.
- The association is optional and can be cleared at any time without affecting the Context.
- If a Context is deleted, all tasks must have already removed the reference (enforced by deletion guard).

---

### Task ↔ Project (many-to-one, optional)

```
Task 0..* ──── 0..1 Project
```

- A Task may be associated with zero or one Project.
- A Project may be associated with zero or many Tasks.
- The association is set via `Task.projectId`.
- The association is optional and can be cleared at any time without affecting the Project.
- If a Project is deleted, all tasks must have already removed the reference (enforced by deletion guard).
